            <h2>About Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Causes of Climate Change</p>
            <p>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:<br></p>
                
            <p>Burning of Fossil Fuels: The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation is the largest source of CO₂ emissions.<br>
                Deforestation: Cutting down trees reduces the planet’s capacity to absorb CO₂.<br>
                Industrial Processes: Certain industrial activities release various greenhouse gases.<br>
                Agriculture: Livestock produce methane, and agricultural practices release nitrous oxide.<br>
                Land Use Changes: Urbanization and deforestation contribute to climate change by altering the Earth's surface and its ability to absorb or reflect sunlight.<br>
                Other Human Activities: Activities such as waste management and the use of synthetic chemicals contribute to the release of GHGs.<br></p>
                Effects of Climate Change</p><p>
                Rising Temperatures: Average global temperatures have increased, leading to heatwaves and changes in weather patterns.<br>
                Melting Ice Caps and Glaciers: The polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, contributing to sea-level rise.<br>
                Rising Sea Levels: Sea levels are rising due to melting ice and the thermal expansion of seawater.<br>
                Extreme Weather Events: There is an increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.<br>
                Ocean Acidification: Increased CO₂ levels are causing the oceans to become more acidic, affecting marine life.<br>
                Loss of Biodiversity: Species are being forced to migrate or face extinction due to changing habitats and climates.<br></p>
                <p>Mitigation and Adaptation<br></p>
                Reducing Emissions: Transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and reducing deforestation are crucial steps.<br>
                Carbon Sequestration: Techniques like reforestation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) aim to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere.<br>
                Policy and Legislation: Governments and international bodies are implementing policies and agreements like the Paris Agreement to limit global warming.<br>
                Adaptation Strategies: Building resilient infrastructure, developing sustainable agriculture, and planning for sea-level rise are important adaptation measures.<br>
                <p>International Efforts<br></p>
                Paris Agreement: An international treaty adopted in 2015 aimed at limiting global warming to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.<br>
                Kyoto Protocol: An earlier international agreement that set binding targets for industrialized countries to reduce GHG emissions.<br>
                United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): An international environmental treaty aimed at stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere.<br>
                <p>Personal Actions<br></p>
                Reducing Energy Use: Using energy-efficient appliances, reducing car travel, and using public transportation.<br>
                Sustainable Consumption: Eating a plant-based diet, reducing waste, and recycling.<br>
                Supporting Policies: Advocating for climate-friendly policies and supporting organizations working to combat climate change.<br>
                Climate change is a complex and urgent issue that requires coordinated efforts from individuals, governments, and organizations worldwide to mitigate its effects and adapt to its impacts.</p>
